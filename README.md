#  Traditional SDL Ray Caster

A low-level, traditional ray casting engine built in **C++** using **SDL3**. This project is a homage to the early days of 3D rendering, showcasing the principles behind games like *Wolfenstein 3D* and *DOOM*. It renders a pseudo-3D environment using efficient 2D mathematics and a handcrafted graphics pipeline.

##  Features

-  Ray casting engine implemented from scratch  
-  Real-time rendering with **SDL3**  
-  2D grid-based level system  
-  Lightweight and modular C++ code  
-  Keyboard-based navigation and interaction  
-  Designed for learning graphics fundamentals

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

##  Installation

Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsdl3-dev
make
./raycaster


```
#  Build & Run :
 1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akshat-singh90056/Traditional-SDL_Ray-Caster.git
    cd Traditional-SDL_Ray-Caster


```
  2. Compile the project:

 ```bash
     make

 ```

  3. Run the raycaster:

  ```bash

     ./raycaster

  ```

  #  Project Structure

  ```bash

  Traditional-SDL_Ray-Caster/
├── main.cpp           # Entry point and main SDL loop
├── tracer.cpp/.h      # Ray casting engine and rendering logic
├── map.c/.h           # 2D map grid layout and wall detection
├── makefile           # Build automation
└── .vscode/           # Optional editor config (for VS Code)

  ```
##  Controls :

   1. W & S Keys – Move forward/backward 
   2. Mouse courser - to give direction to the ray

#  Understanding Ray Casting:

 Ray casting simulates a 3D environment using 2D mathematics:

  1. Cast rays from the player’s viewpoint at varying angles

  2. Detect wall collisions in a grid

  3. Measure distances to intersections

  4. Draw scaled vertical slices to simulate depth

  5. It was the backbone of early FPS engines and remains a powerful educational tool.

##  Thanks for Reading :

This project is a foundational exploration into classic ray casting using SDL3 — a technique that powered the earliest first-person engines and continues to inspire graphics programming to this day.

If you find this useful, interesting, or nostalgic — feel free to  star the repository or fork it for your own experiments.
